Introduction
Managing attendance in organizations, schools, and events can be a time-consuming task. The Face Recognition Attendance System automates this process by utilizing facial recognition algorithms to accurately identify and record attendance of individuals. This system eliminates the need for manual sign-ins and enhances efficiency.

Features
Face Recognition: Utilizes advanced facial recognition techniques to identify individuals accurately.
Real-time Processing: Performs recognition in real-time, allowing swift attendance management.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for both administrators and attendees.
Automated Recording: Automatically records attendance in a digital database.
Data Security: Ensures data security and privacy through encryption and secure storage.
Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the Face Recognition Attendance System on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
Webcam or camera device

Configuration
Adjust the system's behavior by modifying the configuration .You can customize settings related to face recognition, database, and user interface.

How It Works
The Face Recognition Attendance System uses pre-trained deep learning models to detect and recognize faces from the input camera feed. Detected faces are compared against a database of registered individuals using feature vectors. If a match is found, attendance is marked for the corresponding person.
